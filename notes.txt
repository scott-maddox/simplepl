TODO:
-allow changing the spectrometer diverters
-remember the last save and open directories and start there
-use a system-wide lock file to ensure only one instance runs
-set lock-in's time constant and reserve before each scan
-add raw curve


-wait an extra delay when grating or filter changed
--probably need to combine spectrometer and lockin classes into one
---that should simplify a lot of things
-fix error when starting scan immediately upon startup, before the wavelength
can be read
-show status, like what instrument is being waited on

-allow settings & display of these:
--lockin
---time constant
---reserve
---line filter
---2x line filter
--spectrometer
---entrance mirror
---exit mirror

-color the plots & add raw and phase curves
--phase requires another y-axis on the right
-add photon energy scale at the top?
-add closeAction (Ctrl+W)
